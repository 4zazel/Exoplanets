# Exo-Explorer
Helping the youth explore space!

Our goal was to show the exciting world of space exploration to the younger generation.
Exo-Explorer helps to visualize how versitile and surreal the cosmos can be to hopefully get the user interested in whats beyond the earth. 

Exo-Explorer uses 3D models to help the user visualize what the unexplored planets look like. 
By including 3D Meshes in our application we hope to make the user feel like they are on a journey through space, observing these celestial bodies.
You can find a brief explanation and history of exoplanets before exploring space.
We wanted to make the User Interface as simple as possible to make it easy for younger people to use.
Our app also includes a section dedicated to more specific information about each exoplanet and a size comparison to our home earth.
